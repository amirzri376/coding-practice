# Coding Practice Repository

This repository is a personal collection of coding problems Iâ€™ve solved using C++, Java, and Python, primarily from LeetCode and similar platforms.

The goal of this repository is **not** to provide the most optimized or elegant solutions, but to **record how I personally solved each problem at the time**. It's a way for me to:

- Track my progress over time
- Reflect on how my thinking and coding skills evolve
- Revisit problems and improve on past solutions if needed

I may later revisit some solutions to optimize them, add comments, or refactor for readability

Problems are organized by platform and difficulty (e.g., LeetCode/Easy/TwoSum.cpp). Each file includes problem details and the solution I wrote.
